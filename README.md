# Pokemon GO Team Manager

View and manage your Pokemon GO accounts from your PC

Note that the code is a big garbled mess. I've never made something using two (arguably terrible) languages before. I began working on this before API's for Java and C# were available.

##Submitting an Issue

IF you are having an issue with logging in, please edit auth.bat, and on a new line put the word 'pause' (no quotes ofc). Then, submit an issue with a SCREENSHOT of the full command prompt window, and please upload the contents of output.txt to pastebin or paste.ee (or similar).

OTHERWISE, simply submit an issue describing what you were doing when the error occurs, and please upload the contents of output.txt to pastebin or paste.ee (or similar).
